idk what im doing  
doesnt compile yet, but hoping it does soon  
the code is very messy at some points, and not everything is optimized, but if i stay motivated i hope i can get the game running well 
# to do list  
1. Show queue  
2. Improve the quality of the controls  
3. make the game look nicer  
4. scoring system  
5. title screen potentially  
6. settings to configure the controls  
7. upload a release to github 
8. get people to play to see ways to make the game a more faithful adaptation 
9. it would be really cool to add a multiplayer, but this probably isnt happening
