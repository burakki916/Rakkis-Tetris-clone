pretty functional now, just not complete. 


# to do list  
1. Show queue
    - ~~add music~~ 
2. ~~Add hard drop~~ 
~~3. Improve the quality of the controls  ~~ work still needs to be done here 
4. make the game look nicer 
    * adjust the way the board size and position is determined to be more dynamic. 
5.~~ scoring system done ~~

    make a system to save scores / level data 
    make it so where you can chose what level you start on 

   ~~need to have a level system as well~~
    ~~-make gravity faithful to the games~~ - kindaish 

6. title screen potentially  
7. settings to configure the controls  
8. upload a release to github 
9. get people to play to see ways to make the game a more faithful adaptation (in the process of getting testers)
10. it would be really cool to add a multiplayer, but this probably isnt happening
